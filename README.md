### following instructions on "Statistics in Python"
- link: https://scipy-lectures.org/packages/statistics/index.html#data-representation-and-interaction

### Data representation and interaction
- Data as a table
- The pandas data-frame

### Hypothesis testing: comparing two groups
- Studentâ€™s t-test: the simplest statistical test (1-sample t-test, 2-sample t-test)
- Paired tests: repeated measurements on the same individuals

### Linear models, multiple factors, and analysis of variance
- A simple linear regression
- Categorical variables: comparing groups or multiple categories
- Multiple Regression: including multiple factors
- Post-hoc hypothesis testing: analysis of variance (ANOVA)

### More visualization: seaborn for statistical exploration
- Pairplot: scatter matrices
- lmplot: plotting a univariate regression

### Testing for interactions
